# ✊✋✌️ Rock, Paper, Scissors (Python Game)

A simple terminal-based **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game written in Python. Player 1 (you) plays against the computer (Player 2), and the winner is decided based on classic game rules.

---

## 📌 Overview

- Player 1 inputs a choice: `rock (R)`, `paper (P)`, or `scissors (S)`.
- The computer (Player 2) randomly chooses its move.
- The game compares both choices and declares a winner or a tie.
- After each round, you can choose to **play again or exit**.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- `random.choice()` for computer's move
- `input()` for player interaction
- `if-else` conditionals for outcome logic
- `while` loop for repeating rounds
- String methods like `.upper()` and `.lower()`
