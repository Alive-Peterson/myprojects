# 🛒 Walmart Sales Analysis Dashboard

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing Walmart’s weekly sales performance across multiple stores and years. The dashboard provides insights into sales trends, store performance, and the effect of external factors like holidays, fuel prices, and temperature on sales.

## 📊 Project Overview

The Walmart Sales Analysis Dashboard was built to explore and visualize:

Sales performance over time

Top-performing stores

Yearly sales trends

The relationship between sales and external economic/environmental factors

## 🧾 Dataset Information

The dataset used contains Walmart’s historical sales data with attributes such as:

Store – Store number

Date – Week ending date

Weekly_Sales – Sales for the given week

Holiday_Flag – Whether the week included a major holiday (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

Temperature – Average temperature for the week

Fuel_Price – Cost of fuel in the region

CPI – Consumer Price Index

Unemployment – Unemployment rate for the area

## 🧠 Key Insights from Dashboard
1. 📈 Overall Sales Performance

Total Sales: 6.74 billion

Average Sales: 1.05 million

Maximum Single Store Sales: 3.82 million

Total Stores Analyzed: 45

2. 🏬 Top Performing Stores

Stores 20, 4, 14, 13, and 2 recorded the highest total sales across all years.

3. 📅 Sales Trend Over Time

Monthly sales show fluctuations, peaking during mid-year (June–August).

A noticeable dip is observed around November, possibly due to pre-holiday inventory cycles.

4. 🎉 Holiday vs Non-Holiday Sales

Sales during non-holiday weeks accounted for 92.5% of total sales.

Holiday weeks, though fewer, contributed a significant 7.5% increase per occurrence.

5. 🌡️ External Factors Impact

The bubble chart indicates that higher sales tend to align with moderate temperatures (50°F–70°F).

Stores maintain steady performance regardless of changes in Fuel Price and CPI, showing resilience in customer demand.
